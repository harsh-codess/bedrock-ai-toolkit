# AWS Bedrock Integration Project

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This cloud application requires paid AWS services. AWS Bedrock charges for model inference requests and may incur significant costs depending on usage. Please review AWS Bedrock pricing before proceeding.

A comprehensive project demonstrating integration with Amazon Bedrock, AWS's fully managed service for building generative AI applications with foundation models.

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides examples and utilities for working with AWS Bedrock's foundation models, including text generation, conversational AI, and other generative AI capabilities.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 16+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Boto3 (for Python) or AWS SDK (for Node.js)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Python Setup
```bash
pip install boto3 aws-cli
aws configure
```

### Node.js Setup
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
aws configure
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

2. Ensure your AWS account has access to Bedrock models:
   - Navigate to AWS Bedrock console
   - Request access to desired foundation models
   - Wait for approval (may take some time)

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Text Generation
```python
import boto3
import json

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')

# Example using Claude model
response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId='anthropic.claude-v2',
    body=json.dumps({
        "prompt": "Human: Hello, how are you?\n\nAssistant:",
        "max_tokens_to_sample": 300
    })
)

print(response['body'])
```
